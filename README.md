# Thrift Server

A set of libraries for building microservices in Node.js, written in TypeScript.

As the name would suggest these libraries use [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) for service-to-service communication with RPC. All libraries come ready with distributed tracing through [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/).

The available libraries:
* [Thrift Server Hapi](https://github.com/creditkarma/thrift-server/tree/master/packages/thrift-server-hapi): Plugin to add Thrift support to Hapi.
* [Thrift Server Express](https://github.com/creditkarma/thrift-server/tree/master/packages/thrift-server-express): Middleware to add Thrift support to Express.
* [Thrift Client](https://github.com/creditkarma/thrift-server/tree/master/packages/thrift-client): Thrift HTTP client built on top of [Request](https://github.com/request/request).
